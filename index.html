                    <p><a href="mutuumfinances.github.io">Mutuum Finance</a> Mutuum (MUTM) is a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol that enables users to engage as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. Lenders deposit their crypto assets into Mutuum’s liquidity pools to earn interest, while borrowers can obtain overcollateralized loans by securing them with sufficient collateral. 
</p>
                    
                    
                    

                    <p>Lenders contribute to liquidity by depositing cryptocurrencies into a pooled contract. Concurrently, borrowers can access these funds by providing collateral within the same contract. This system does not require individual loan matching but instead operates based on the collective pool of funds and the associated collaterals and borrowings.
</p><h2>Maximize Earnings, Minimize Effort, Lend, Borrow, Contribute and Earn with Mutuum
</h2>
<p>Mutuum Finance is a decentralized protocol that enables users to lend and borrow various digital assets through both pool-based (P2C) and direct (P2P) models. It aims to offer accessible liquidity, flexible interest rates, and a broad selection of supported tokens-catering to diverse risk profiles and strategies within the evolving DeFi ecosystem.
</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Peer-To-Contract (P2C) Model

The P2C model connects lenders and borrowers via a shared liquidity pool, boosting capital efficiency. Depositors earn interest on supplied funds, while borrowers provide overcollateralized collateral to ensure stability. Rates adjust dynamically based on usage, fostering a balanced ecosystem.</li><br>
                        <li>Peer-To-Peer (P2P) Model

The P2P model allows users directly lend and borrow more speculative assets like PEPE or SHIB while preserving the protocol’s overall security. By isolating these volatile tokens in a dedicated marketplace, users can explore a wider range of trades. This approach enables the inclusion of assets typically avoided in the P2C environment due to their higher risk.</li><br>
                        <li>Variable and Stable Borrow Rates

Mutuum offers users the option to choose between variable and stable borrow rates to best meet their preferences and provide greater predictability for those who desire it. Variable rates fluctuate based on pool utilization, while stable rates remain fixed, ensuring predictable repayments.</li><br><li>Passive Dividend Yield

Users can passively receive dividends derived from the platform's profits. Mutuum purchases its native token, MUTM, at market price and distributes it to users who contribute to the platform's security. This approach not only rewards users but also applies strong and consistent buying pressure on the platform's token.</li>
                        
                        
                        

                    </ul>

                    <h2>How to buy
Mutuum Coins</h2>
<p>Step 1 - Wallet Setup

Start by setting up a crypto wallet using popular options like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Download the extension or app, create your wallet, and be sure to securely store your seed phrase to prevent losing access to your assets. Next, top-up your wallet with the cryptocurrencies supported in the presale.</p>
                    

                    

                    <p>Step 2 - Buying Process

Ready to invest? Just choose your preferred currency and chain on our site, enter the amount of MUTM tokens you'd like to purchase, and click "Buy Now." Your wallet will prompt you to confirm the transaction and display any gas fees.
</p>

                    
                    

                    
<p>Step 3 - View Your Purchase

Congratulations! Now you're officially part of Mutuum. You can now check your purchase and view the amount of tokens you hold under the "Balance" section on the presale screen. If the balance has not updated, please wait a while as transactions on the Ethereum network are slower, and consider refreshing the page if necessary.
</p>


<p>Step 4 - Claim Your Tokens

After the presale ends, you'll be able to claim your MUTM tokens directly from our website. In the meantime, you can keep track of your investment and view token prices from the dashboard. Just connect your wallet to our website, and you're all set!
</p>



<h3>Why should I borrow if I need to deposit collateral?</h3>
                    <p>Borrowing with collateral allows users to unlock liquidity without selling the assets they already hold, potentially avoiding capital gains taxes or missing out on future market growth. For instance, someone who believes their ETH will appreciate might deposit it as collateral to borrow stablecoins and invest elsewhere, or cover immediate expenses, while still retaining exposure to ETH’s price movements. A trader could also borrow to set up hedging strategies, amplify yields via leveraged positions, or seize timely opportunities in other parts of the market - all without relinquishing ownership of key assets.
</p>
                    <h4>What are mtTokens?
</h4>

                    <p>mtTokens are tokenized representations of a user’s deposit in Mutuum’s liquidity pools. When you deposit an asset (e.g., ETH or DAI) into the protocol, you receive a corresponding amount of mtTokens reflecting both your initial deposit and the interest it generates over time. This process allows you to maintain liquidity and track earnings seamlessly, as each mtToken automatically accrues value based on real-time lending and borrowing activity within Mutuum Finance.</p><h3>How do I receive the passive dividend in MUTM?
</h3>
<p>Mutuum plans to distribute passive dividends by using a portion of its protocol revenue to buy MUTM tokens on the open market. Those purchased tokens are then sent to safety-module participants who stake mtTokens in designated contracts. By staking, you become eligible for these dividends whenever the protocol executes a buyback and distribution cycle, ensuring that long-term contributors benefit from both ecosystem growth and additional MUTM rewards.
</p><h3>What are liquidation ?
</h3>
<p>Liquidations occur when a borrower’s collateral becomes insufficient to cover their outstanding debt, causing the protocol to sell or seize part of that collateral to recover the loan. If market conditions or price fluctuations drive your Stability Factor below the required threshold, Mutuum can trigger a liquidation event to protect the broader liquidity pool. While it ensures the protocol remains solvent, timely monitoring and maintaining healthy collateralization can help users avoid liquidation.

                    <h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
                    <p>Mutuum Finance showcases how next-generation DeFi protocols are built: user-first, secure, and utility-driven. Through its innovative lending models, attention to token value, and commitment to security, Mutuum is poised to reshape decentralized lending.
